                                    The Yibby Platform provides a marketplace where persons who seek transportation to certain
                                    destinations (“Riders”) can be matched with persons driving to or through those destinations
                                    (“Drivers”). Drivers and Riders are collectively referred to herein as “Users,” and each User shall
                                    create a User account that enables access to the Yibby Platform. For purposes of this Agreement,
                                    the driving services provided by Drivers to Riders that are matched through the Platform shall be
                                    referred to collectively as the “Services”. Any decision by a User to offer or accept Services is a
                                    decision made in such User’s sole discretion. Each transportation Service provided by a Driver to a
                                    Rider shall constitute a separate agreement between such persons.
                                </p>

                                <p class="type--bold">Modification to the Agreement</p>

                                    In the event Yibby modifies the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such modifications shall
                                    be binding on you only upon your acceptance of the modified Agreement. Yibby reserves the right
                                    to modify any information referenced in the hyperlinks from this Agreement from time to time,
                                    and such modifications shall become effective upon posting. Continued use of the Yibby Platform
                                    or Services after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. Unless material
                                    changes are made to the arbitration provisions herein, you agree that modification of this
                                    Agreement does not create a renewed opportunity to opt out of arbitration (if applicable).

                                    The Yibby Platform may only be used by individuals who can form legally binding contracts under
                                    applicable law. The Yibby Platform is not available to children (persons under the age of 18) or
                                    Users who have had their User account temporarily or permanently deactivated. By becoming a

                                    User, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old and that you have the right,
                                    authority and capacity to enter into and abide by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You
                                    may not allow other persons to use your User account, and you agree that you are the sole
                                    authorized user of your account.

                                    (“Charges”). Charges include Fares and other applicable fees, tolls, surcharges, and taxes as set
                                    forth on your Yibby’s page (www.yibbyapp.com), plus any tips to the Driver that you elect to pay.
                                    Yibby has the authority and reserves the right to determine and modify pricing by posting
                                    applicable pricing terms to your Yibby’s page. Pricing may vary based on the price the rider bids
                                    and the driver accepts or counters. You are responsible for reviewing the applicable Yibby How To
                                    page and shall be responsible for all Charges incurred under your User account regardless of your
                                    awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof.

                                    <li>Variable Fares. Variable fares consist of a base charge and incremental charges based on the
                                        duration and distance of your ride. We will use this information to provide a suggested price for
                                        you to start your bid. Please note that we use GPS data from your Driver’s phone to calculate
                                        the distance traveled on your ride. We cannot guarantee the availability or accuracy of GPS
                                        data. If we lose signal we will calculate time and distance using available data from your ride.

                                    <li>Bided Fares. Bidded fares are when riders use the Variable Fares to calculate a fare that best
                                        suits their price they are willing to pay. Riders send their bid to drivers who will either accept or
                                        Counter Offer with a bid of their own for the riders to either accept or decline.

                                    <li>Counter Offer. In some cases drivers may not accept the riders initial bid and counter offer for a
                                        different price at the time of your request. The Counter Offer can be accepted or declined by the

Riders and Drivers. Riders and Drivers that have been matched for a
ride are able to see basic information about each other, such as
names, photo, ratings, and any information they have added to their
Profiles. Riders and Drivers who connect their Yibby accounts to
Facebook will also be able to see their mutual Facebook friends
during the ride. Drivers see the pick-up location that the Rider has
provided. Riders see a Driver’s vehicle information and real-time
location as the Driver approaches the pick-up location. Riders’
ratings of Drivers are shared with Drivers on a weekly basis. We
de-identify the ratings and feedback, but we can’t rule out that a
driver may be able to identify the Rider that provided the rating or
feedback.</FONT></FONT></P>
